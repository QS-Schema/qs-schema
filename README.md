# QS Schema
Quantified Self has historically been an individualized endeavor. Quantified Selfers are excited to share and learn from others, but also tend to take their own path, tinker, and build the tools that they need for themselves. It’s difficult to use the tools that others have built because they often don’t accommodate the specific *data structure* that you might wish they did.

We believe that making Quantified Self tools more interoperable and easy to build will open up new ways to use QS data, not only for individuals, but also for researchers, academics and data analysts who are interested in gaining new insights from this valuable resource.

We propose a standardized quantified self data schema. One that is flexible, interoperable across tools and driven and developed by the QS community. The purpose of this document is to collaborate on the development of this data structure.

## Prior Art
* [Open mHealth](https://www.openmhealth.org/documentation/#/schema-docs/schema-library)
* [Schema.org](https://schema.org/docs/full.html)

## Open Questions
* How do we handle time?
* How do we collaborate, work together and make decisions?
* How do we deal with adding new types of data to the standard?
* How do we allow for flexibility if the standard doesn’t include a data type that you wish to use?
